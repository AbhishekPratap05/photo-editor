# Photo Editing Website
## uses CSS filter to edit image and user 👪 can download the image 🖼️

### It uses react by create-react-app
### Planing to change the UI of editor and add more filters, mostly will use the filter provided by the community and will link to their repository if I do so.

### 💡 Planing on changing the way photo is being edited, will change pixles rather than applying CSS filters to canvas. Articles found to implement are [manipulating-pixels-using-canvas](https://css-tricks.com/manipulating-pixels-using-canvas/) and [Image Filters with Canvas](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/imagefilters/)
